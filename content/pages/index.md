DyND is a C++ library for dynamic, multidimensional arrays. It is inspired by NumPy, the Python array programming library at the core of the scientific Python stack, but tries to address a number of obstacles encountered by some of its users. Examples of this are support for variable-sized string, ragged array types, and convenient usage from C++. The library is in a preview development state, and can be thought of as a sandbox where features are being tried and tweaked to gain experience with them.

The core DyND developer team consists of
[Mark Wiebe](https://github.com/mwiebe),
[Irwin Zaid](https://github.com/izaid), and [Ian Henriksen](https://github.com/insertinterestingnamehere).
Much of the funding that made this project possible came through [Continuum Analytics](http://continuum.io/) and
[DARPA-BAA-12-38](https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=7a77846c73ffc5cb22f9295ffe6cdd55&tab=core&_cview=0),
