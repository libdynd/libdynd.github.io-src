title: GSoC
heading: Google Summer of Code

[GSoC 2016](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline?hl=en) is ramping up,
currently in the phase accepting mentoring organization applications. We are happy to be applying
under the [umbrella of NumFOCUS](https://github.com/numfocus/gsoc) again, and hope for
another successful summer!

DyND participated in [GSoC](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) 2015 under the
[NumFOCUS](http://www.numfocus.org/programs.html) umbrella. We were fortunate to get a [great proposal](https://github.com/numfocus/gsoc/blob/master/2015/proposals/ian-henriksen.md) from 
[Ian Henriksen](https://github.com/insertinterestingnamehere) and be accepted into the program. You can read [his blog](http://insertinterestingnamehere.github.io/) to see the
whole process, including some
[first impressions](http://insertinterestingnamehere.github.io/posts/first-impressions-and-overcoming-compilation-errors.html),
[contributions to Cython](http://insertinterestingnamehere.github.io/posts/cython-collaboration.html)
to expand its C++ support, and
[concluding thoughts](http://insertinterestingnamehere.github.io/posts/gsoc-concluding-thoughts.html).
The project worked out great, and Ian is now a core developer of DyND.
